# AndroidPractical

I have completed part 1 and part 2 fully but part 3 is incomplete. I was not able to create a recyleview to put into the Fragment.

I found XML UX/UI design to be easy. I also understand thread pretty well and why they are useful and needed, . I also found Shared Preferences to be easy.

I found RecyclerView to be difficult, I need to practice more on this. I was unable to complete this part. I also need to practice the Java implementation of concurrency more, I don't remember how a lot of the syntaxes work.
